**Context:** 
- This project focused on harnessing artificial intelligence for short-term weather forecasting, specifically for extreme weather conditions like hail storm. 
- The objective was to provide timely and accurate forecasts for such events, which could have significant implications for a variety of industries, including insurance.

**Responsibilities:**
- My primary responsibilities included researching and implementing a data processing system for radar data obtained from both X-band and C-band radars. Additionally, we developed a "nowcast" system capable of predicting extreme weather events in the short term. The nowcast system acted as an early warning tool.

**Challenges and Difficulties:**
- This project presented challenges in terms of understanding and processing radar data from different bands, and the complexity of developing AI models for predicting extreme weather events. The main challenge was to provide accurate forecasts in a short time frame, which required a deep understanding of meteorological data and generative deep learning techniques.

**Accomplishments:**
- One of the significant achievements of the project was the creation of a prototype for a Short-term Hail Nowcast, demonstrating our ability to forecast hailstorms in advance. In compariosn with forecast system provided by Japan Meteorological Agency(JMA), our forecast system achieve better accuracy (ours: 72% , JMA: 55%)
- We also delivered a Proof of Concept (PoC) to the MS&AD insurance group, showcasing the practical value of the technology for industries like insurance, where weather-related risks can have substantial financial implications.

**Relevance to the Business:**
- The project's primary relevance was in providing early warnings for extreme weather conditions, which can help various industries, especially insurance, in assessing and mitigating weather-related risks. It was crucial for the insurance sector to understand and manage these risks effectively.

**Transferable Skills:**
- Analytical skills, Quantitative Analysis, Data visualization, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Expertise (anomaly detection and risk assessment), Weather Domain Knowledge.
- Leadership, project management, and problem-solving skills.
