**Context:** 
- This project aimed to develop a sophisticated tool for Japanese newspapers that automates the placement of content on the pages. - The goal was to enhance the efficiency and quality of newspaper layout design in the Japanese market.

**Responsibilities:**
- As the Team Leader, my responsibilities included leading, researching and developing an API (Application Programming Interface) for an automatic newspaper layout tool. This API is essentially a bridge between the user and the tool, allowing for seamless automation of content placement on newspaper pages.

**Challenges and Difficulties:**
- Developing this tool involved understanding the unique preferences of the Japanese market, and design principles. We had to ensure that the tool catered to these specific requirements, which added complexity to the project.

**Accomplishments:**
- One significant achievement was securing a patent for the Typesetting API, indicating the uniqueness and innovation of our approach. Additionally, we successfully delivered a Proof of Concept (PoC) to renowned companies like Toshiba and Fujitsu, showcasing the practical value of the technology.

**Relevance to the Business:**
- This project was highly relevant to the newspaper industry in Japan as it significantly improved the process of newspaper layout and design. It allowed newspapers to operate more efficiently, reduce costs, and provide a better reading experience for their audience.

**Transferable Skills:**
- Analytical skills, Data visualization, Constraint Programming and Deep Reinforcement Learning (portfolio optimization and credit scoring).
- Leadership, project management, and problem-solving skills.
