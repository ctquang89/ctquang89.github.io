description: "Develop an autoconder, which is a neural network trained to reproduce the input while learning a new representation of the data, to analyze the impact of some factors including economic conditions, investor behavior, or other mysterious influences on asset returns. The primary advantages include reducing pricing errors and ensuring adherence to economic principles within the developed pricing model."
