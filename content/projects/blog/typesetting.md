**Abstract:**
The typesetting project aimed to create an AI-driven solution to automate the labor-intensive process of newspaper article arrangement, addressing several critical challenges. Manual typesetting is notoriously time-consuming and stressful, often leading to inconsistent layouts and potential human errors. These issues not only hinder productivity but also limit the ability to explore diverse solutions for optimal newspaper design. By leveraging Assistive AI, this project seeks to significantly reduce the manual workload, enhance operational efficiency, and ensure consistent output quality. The successful application of this technology in typesetting showcases its potential transferability to other industries facing similar manual challenges, offering a scalable solution for improving efficiency and reducing human error across various fields.

**Introduction:**
Typical typesetting process used in newspaper company
p1: makeing rough layouts
p2: Making layout arrangement on computer​

The process last about 12 hours and it is very stressful.

**Solutions:**
By leveraging constraint optimization and Reinforcement Learning (a sub-field of  Machine Learning) techniques, I developed a novel solution that automates the typesetting process, significantly reducing the time required and minimizing the risk of human errors. This AI solution was implemented as a proof of concept and was showcased to ToO newspaper company.
