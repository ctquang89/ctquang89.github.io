description: "Japan, a nation celebrated for its stunning natural beauty, also grapples with the persistent threat of severe weather events. From typhoons and earthquakes to torrential rains, snowstorms, and hailstorms, these disasters often result in significant damage to property, infrastructure, and, most tragically, human life. In such a volatile environment, timely and precise weather information is essential for safeguarding public safety and mitigating the effects of these events. This post highlights a cutting-edge weather forecast model specifically designed for hail prediction. Remarkably, this model outperforms the Japan Meteorological Agency's (JMA) existing hail prediction model, achieving an accuracy rate of 72%—a substantial improvement of 17% over JMA's 55%."

&emsp; The skies over Japan often paint a dramatic picture, with thunderstorms booming, strong winds blowing, and hailstones crashing onto rooftops and fields. During this severe weather, communities prepare for the worst, farmers try to save their crops, and emergency services get ready to help. However, predicting hail – a weather event that can cause serious damage to people and property – has always been a difficult and uncertain task. But what if this challenge could be tackled with precision and foresight using the power of Artificial Intelligence?

&emsp; This post provide general information of a Hail Forecast system used in <a href="https://www.mti.co.jp/?p=33519">Hail Alert Service in Japan provided by MTI </a> By harnessing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and analyzing extensive historical weather radar data, this system aims to:

* **Improve accuracy and lead time:** Provide more accurate and timely predictions of hail events. 
* **Enhance early warning systems:** Empower weather information service providers to issue more precise and timely warnings to the public, allowing for swift evacuation and precautionary measures.
* **Enable proactive risk management:** Equip individuals, businesses, and government agencies with the necessary information to proactively assess risks and implement effective mitigation strategies.

I. Basics - What is hail?
-----
<div style="text-align:justify">
Hail is a type of precipitation made up of solid ice that forms within the strong updrafts of thunderstorms. As water droplets are lifted high into the cold upper layers of a storm, they freeze into layers of ice, eventually falling to the ground as hailstones when they become too heavy for the updrafts to support. Hail poses a significant threat, capable of damaging aircraft, vehicles, homes, and even crops. It can also be fatal to livestock and dangerous to people. Hailstones vary widely in size, ranging from as small as a pea (1/4 inch in diameter) to as large as a grapefruit (4 1/2 inches in diameter). Hailstones of quarter size (1 inch) or larger are classified as severe, with larger sizes, such as golf balls (1 3/4 inches) or softballs (4 inches), causing extensive damage.
